## What is the MALfunction Hackathon

This event is designed to educate participants on the inner workings of malware in a controlled environment and give a chance to get into the head of a malware developer. At the start of the hackaton you will be given a theme, a target OS and "Actions on Objectives" AOO is what we consider the attackers goals. What they want to acomplish with this malware, it could be to deploy ransomware, it could be exfiltrate a lot of data you wont know until the hackathon starts.
